# Dev Tips

## How to use number revisions 
### When using git, revisions belong on tags and nowhere else.
* 0.00-.99 -- beta/alpha 
* 1.0   -- initial stable release
* 1.0.1 -- minor update (1.0.01 format if you plan 10+ updates between features)
* 1.1.0 -- added features
* 2.0.0 -- big step up, may not be compatible or optimised for version 1x

## What is not an improvement with respect to user-side features
1. If it takes more steps to achieve than before: not an improvement.
2. If you can achieve no more than what was possible before: not an improvement.
